# SteamClient Proto

An UI-only Steam client app, for fun.

## Getting Started

This app is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (dev branch). It is inspired by [Steam mobile app design](https://dribbble.com/shots/8143099-Steam-mobile-app-Redesign-UI) by Aveg Vanetsyan and [the one](https://dribbble.com/shots/10537483-Steam-Mobile-Redesign-Concept) by George Shishov, although some screens are modified from Steam Chat app, which is decent, by my standard.

TODO:

- Integrating real Steam's public API into the app, including Featured, deals, searching.
- Complete User Preferences screen.
- Countdown animation for Steam Guard.
- Apply new design.
